tidy.py: a simple script to organize objects in images of space by their size.

Pretty crude at this point. Requires scikit-image; performs blob-finding.

See http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/plot_blob.html#example-plot-blob-py

... for the basis of the approach.

Default uses the Difference of Hessians (doh), which is pretty fast. For a given image, you may have to tweak threshold, num_sigma, and max_sigma in the blob_doh call to get good performance. 

BE CAREFUL as if you set threshold too low you can quickly consume all free memory.

Try it!
